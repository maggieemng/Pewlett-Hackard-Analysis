# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS

The purpose of this analysis is to create to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We will be creating tables to help analyze the two. We used data points such as employee number, title, gender, start/end dates, etc. to include in the tables.

### RESULTS

The table that represents number of retiring employees per title:

1. Senior engineers make up almost 1/3 of the retirees. 
2. As a result we understand that the company is losing its senior staff quickly and the tables prove that.
3. The turnover/retirement rate is higher than mentorship/number of younger staff which means the company needs to reevaluate it's programs in order to have balance. 
4. The company also needs to set in place better training materials for its junior engineers/incoming engineers as most of them are retiring and there will be less mentorship/resources. 

### SUMMARY
###### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

Over 100k

###### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Seems not.
